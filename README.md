# CGOL-TwoGD-Version

This is just a demonstration of how you could use [TwoGD](https://github.com/inimodo/TwoGD). In this case [Conways Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) was realized, which is a simulation of "living" cells on a 2D playfield. The idea is that, a individual cells life is depended on how many other cells surround it, and given a few rules lives seems to appear. This is a very common coding project, but also a nice visual demonstration of the direct screen buffer writing capabilities of TwoGD. This demo does not even use any drawing/rendering features of TwoGD, rather it directly updates the window screen buffer. Therefore, you could realize this with only [EasyWin](https://github.com/inimodo/EasyWin), which is just the window management without any drawing code.
